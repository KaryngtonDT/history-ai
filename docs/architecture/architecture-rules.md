# Architecture Rules

Version: 1.0

Status: Active

---

# Purpose

This document defines **enforceable dependency rules** for History AI. Rules are checked automatically by architecture tests in backend, worker, and frontend.

When a rule is violated, the corresponding test suite **fails in CI**.

Related ADRs: [docs/architecture/README.md](./README.md)

# Backend (Symfony)

## Layer model

```text
Presentation
      │
      ▼
Application
      │
      ▼
Domain
      ▲
      │
Infrastructure
```

| Layer | May depend on | Must not depend on |
| ----- | ------------- | ------------------ |
| **Domain** | Domain, PHP stdlib | Symfony, Doctrine, Infrastructure, Presentation |
| **Application** | Domain, Application | Infrastructure, Presentation |
| **Presentation** | Domain, Application, Presentation, Symfony | Infrastructure |
| **Infrastructure** | Domain, Application, Infrastructure, Doctrine | Presentation |

Presentation may reference Domain value objects and exceptions when parsing HTTP input (e.g. `ContentId`, `InvalidContentIdException`). Handlers remain the primary orchestration path.

## Enforcement

| Tool | Location | Command |
| ---- | -------- | ------- |
| PHPUnit architecture tests | `backend/tests/Architecture/` | `docker compose exec backend php bin/phpunit tests/Architecture` |
| Deptrac config (reference) | `backend/deptrac.yaml` | Optional: `vendor/bin/deptrac analyse` after installing Deptrac |

### Rules tested

1. **Domain purity** — no `Symfony\`, `Doctrine\`, `App\Infrastructure\`, `App\Presentation\` imports.
2. **Application isolation** — no Infrastructure or Presentation imports.
3. **Presentation boundary** — no direct Infrastructure imports (use Application handlers).
4. **Infrastructure boundary** — no Presentation imports.

### Example violation (fails CI)

```php
// backend/src/Domain/Collection/Collection.php
use Doctrine\ORM\EntityManager; // ❌ forbidden
```

**Fix:** move persistence logic to `Infrastructure/Persistence/Doctrine/` and expose a repository port in Domain.

```php
// backend/src/Application/Collection/Handlers/CreateCollectionHandler.php
use App\Infrastructure\Persistence\Doctrine\Collection\DoctrineCollectionRepository; // ❌ forbidden
```

**Fix:** depend on `CollectionRepositoryInterface` in the handler constructor; wire the Doctrine adapter in Symfony DI config.

# Worker (FastAPI)

## Module model

```text
ProcessingService
      │
      ▼
ArtifactGeneratorInterface / SummaryGeneratorInterface
      │
      ▼
AIProviderInterface
      │
      ▼
MockAIProvider | GeminiProvider
```

| Rule | Rationale |
| ---- | --------- |
| `app/generators/` must not import `GeminiProvider` or `MockAIProvider` | Generators depend on abstractions, not vendors |
| `app/generators/` may import `AIProviderInterface` and `AIProviderFactory` | Factory is the composition root for AI wiring |
| `GeminiProvider` references only in `app/ai/` (plus tests) | Concrete providers stay in the AI adapter layer |

Note: the worker has no `app/domain/` package yet; domain logic lives in services and generators. When a domain package is introduced, it must not import `app/ai`.

## Enforcement

| Tool | Location | Command |
| ---- | -------- | ------- |
| pytest architecture tests | `worker/tests/test_architecture.py` | `docker compose exec worker pytest tests/test_architecture.py` |

### Example violation (fails CI)

```python
# worker/app/generators/QuizArtifactGenerator.py
from app.ai.GeminiProvider import GeminiProvider  # ❌ forbidden
```

**Fix:** accept `AIProviderInterface` via constructor injection; resolve the provider in `AIProviderFactory`.

---

# Frontend (React)

## Layer model

```text
features/ (UI)
      │
      ▼
services/ (use cases)
      │
      ▼
HttpClient + Repository (Http / Mock)
```

| Rule | Rationale |
| ---- | --------- |
| `fetch()` only in `services/http/HttpClient.ts` | Single HTTP gateway; testable mocks |
| Feature modules must not import `Http*Repository` | UI talks to services, not transport |
| Feature modules must not import `HttpClient` | Same as above |

Repository factories and Http repositories live under `services/` and are consumed by service classes only.

## Enforcement

| Tool | Location | Command |
| ---- | -------- | ------- |
| Vitest architecture tests | `frontend/src/architecture/` | Included in `npm test` |

### Example violation (fails CI)

```tsx
// frontend/src/features/processing/ProcessingPage.tsx
const response = await fetch("/api/jobs"); // ❌ forbidden
```

**Fix:** call `processingService.createJob(...)` or the appropriate service method.

```tsx
// frontend/src/features/library/Library.tsx
import { HttpLibraryRepository } from "@/services/library/HttpLibraryRepository"; // ❌ forbidden
```

**Fix:** import `libraryService` from `@/services/library/LibraryService`.

# Running all architecture checks

```bash
# Backend
docker compose exec backend php bin/phpunit tests/Architecture

# Frontend (included in full suite)
docker compose exec frontend npm test

# Worker
docker compose exec worker pytest tests/test_architecture.py
```

Full regression (architecture + business tests):

```bash
docker compose exec backend php bin/phpunit
docker compose exec frontend npm test
docker compose exec worker pytest
```

---

# Adding a new rule

1. Document the rule in this file (context, decision, fix).
2. Add an automated check in the appropriate `tests/Architecture`, `test_architecture.py`, or `src/architecture/` suite.
3. Verify the suite fails with a deliberate violation, then revert.
4. Link to a new ADR if the rule reflects a major architectural decision.

# CI integration (Sprint 11 roadmap)

Architecture tests are designed to run in GitHub Actions alongside existing PHPUnit, Vitest, and pytest jobs. No separate business-logic changes are required — only fail-fast guardrails when dependency boundaries are broken.
